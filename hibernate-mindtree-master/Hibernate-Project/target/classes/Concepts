Working with objects
____________________
--------------------
States of objects in Hibernate - Transient, Persistent, Detached, Removed

Persistent Object
-----------------
An object with db identity associated is called Persistent Object
Two ways of creation -
 1. retrive object from database using get,list,load,uniqueResult
 2. Persist transiant object - save,persist,merge,refresh
 
 
 Detached Objects
 ----------------
 Tx complete, no relationship with database
 Ways to make detached object - close,clear,evict 
 
 Evict - > To remove an object from the session
 Clear - > Completely remove all associated object
 Close - >  Call after TX is completed, session disconnect
 
 Removed Objects
 _______________
 
 When a delete,remove operator is called on it.
 Remove object from database.
 
 
 MappedBy
 ________
 In our example of ONTOOne Mapping, using mappedBy developed a foreign key relationship among tables. no need to manually connect objects.
 
 
 
 AUTO -> Hibernate decides which generator to use, based on db support
 IDENTITY ->All about database
 SEQUENCE ->Values are generated by @SequenceGenerator 
 TABLE ->@TableGenerator, Seperate Table for primary keys is maintained
 
 @Id
	@SequenceGenerator(name="seq1",sequenceName="HIB")
	@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.SEQUENCE)
	
	
@Id
@TableGenerator
